This article is all about configuring and starting an Apache Kafka server on a Windows OS. 
This guide will also provide instructions to set up Java and Apache Zookeeper.
Apache Kafka is a fast and scalable messaging queue, capable of handling heavy loads in context of read and write, i.e. IO-related stuff. 
You can find more about Kafka on <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://kafka.apache.org/</a> 
Apache Kafka requires a running Zookeeper instance, which is used for reliable distributed coordination. 
Please find more about Zookeeper on <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank">https://zookeeper.apache.org/</a>

For this tutorial we are assuming that Zookeeper and Kafka are unzipped in C: drive, but you can unzip them in any location.
Here we are using full-fledged zookeeper and not the one packaged with Kafka because it will be single-node Zookeeper instance. 
If you want you can run Kafka with packaged zookeeper located in Kafka package inside \kafka\bin\windows directory
