A subdeployment is not necessary for the JMS queue to work, but it
allows you to easily target subcomponents of the JMS module to a
single target or group of targets. We will use the subdeployment in
this example to target the following connection factory and JMS
queue to the JMS server we created earlier.

Services > Messaging > JMS Modules
Select TestJMSModule
Select the Subdeployments tab and New
Subdeployment Name: TestSubdeployment
Press Next
Here you can select the target(s) for the subdeployment. You can
choose either Servers (i.e. WebLogic managed servers, such as the
soa_server1) or JMS Servers such as the JMS Server created
earlier. As the purpose of our subdeployment in this example is to
target a specific JMS server, we will choose the JMS Server option.
