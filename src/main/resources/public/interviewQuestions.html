		<th>Question</th>
		<th>Answer</th>
	</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>A sequence of aggregate operations is known as a</td>
	<td><pre>Pipeline</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Each pipeline contains zero or more ___ operations</td>
	<td><pre>Intermediate</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Each pipeline ends with a ___ operation</td>
	<td><pre>Terminal</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>What kind of operation produces another stream as its output?</td>
	<td><pre>Intermediate</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Describe one way in which forEach aggregate operation differs from the enhanced for statement and iterator</td>
	<td><pre>The forEach aggregate operation lets the system decide "how" the iteration takes place. 
	Using aggregate operations lets you focus on "what" instead of "how." </pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>True or False: A stream is similar to a collection in that it is a data structure that stores elements. </td>
	<td>False. Unlike a collection, a stream is not a data structure. It instead carries values from a source through a pipeline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Identify the intermediate and terminal operations in this code:
double average = roster .stream().filter(p -&gt; p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE).mapToInt(Person::getAge).average().getAsDouble();</td>
	<td>Intermediate: filter, mapToInt, Terminal: average
The terminal operation average returns an OptionalDouble. The getAsDouble method is then invoked on that returned object.
It is always a good idea to consult the API Specification for information about whether an operation is intermediate or terminal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The code p -&gt; p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE is an example of what?</td>
	<td>lambda expression</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The code Person::getAge is an example of what</td>
	<td>method reference</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Terminal operations that combine the contents of a stream and return one value are known as what</td>
	<td>Reduction operations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Name one important difference between the Stream.reduce method and the Stream.collect method</td>
	<td>Stream.reduce always creates a new value when it processes an element. Stream.collect modifies (or mutates) the existing value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>If you wanted to process a stream of names, extract the male names, and store them in a new List, would Stream.reduce or Stream.collect be the most appropriate operation to use?</td>
	<td><pre>
The collect operation is most appropriate for collecting into a List
Example:
List&lt;String&gt; namesOfMaleMembersCollect = 
roster.stream().filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE).map(p -> p.getName()).collect(Collectors.toList());	
	</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>True or False: Aggregate operations make it possible to implement parallelism with non-thread-safe collections</td>
	<td>True, provided that you do not modify (mutate) the underlying collection while you are operating on it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Streams are always serial unless otherwise specified. How do you request that a stream be processed in parallel?</td>
	<td>Obtain the parallel stream by invoking parallelStream() instead of stream()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>What is finalize() method</td>
	<td><pre>
It is possible to define a method that will be called just before an object's final destruction by the 
garbage collector. This method is called finalize( ), 
and it can be used to ensure that an object terminates cleanly	
	</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>What are condition to use user-defined object as key to hashmap</td>
	<td><pre>
1. overrider hashcode(), equals() methods
2. That object should be immutable	
	</pre></td>
